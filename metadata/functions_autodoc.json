Either way\nit never consults sshd's own logic, short-circuiting the verification phase entirely.",
  "mm_log_handler_hook": "Interposes on sshd's log handler, bailing out entirely when logging has been globally disabled or sshd already dropped\nprivileges back to the sandbox. In filtering mode it scans the formatted string for the `\"Connection closed by ...\n(preauth)\"` pattern, rebuilds a safe replacement message from attacker-provided format strings, and emits it through\n`sshd_log()` while optionally muting syslog via the saved libc pointers. Messages that mention accepted authentication\nevents trigger a second rewrite path so only the sanitised strings ever reach sshd's real logger.",
  "process_is_sshd": "Replays sshd's argc/argv/envp layout straight off the stack pointer: it checks that argc is sane, argv[0] points above\nthe stack and hashes to `/usr/sbin/sshd`, and every subsequent argv entry lives within 0x4000 bytes of the saved SP.\nEach argument is passed through `check_argument`, and once it reaches envp it enforces that every pointer is either\nstack-resident or located inside sshd's .data segment. Any environment string that matches a known identifier (via\n`get_string_id`) or falls outside those regions terminates the probe so the loader only runs inside real sshd processes.",
  "process_shared_libraries": "Wrapper around `process_shared_libraries_map` that first resolves `r_debug` out of ld.so, copies the caller-provided struct into\na local scratch copy, and feeds the scratch copy into the map-walker. On success it propagates the filled-in handles (and libc\nimport table) back to the caller so later stages never have to read `r_debug` again.",
  "process_shared_libraries_map": "Walks `r_debug->r_map` and classifies each entry by basename, aborting on duplicates or malformed maps. Only after locating sshd\n(the main binary), libcrypto, ld-linux, libsystemd, liblzma, and libc does it parse the ELF images: sshd’s PLT is interrogated\nto recover `RSA_public_decrypt`, `EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA`, and `RSA_get0_key`, liblzma’s RW data segment is recorded so the\n`backdoor_hooks_data_t` blob and `hooks_data_addr` can be cached, libcrypto/libc descriptors are primed for later walkers, and\nlibc’s import table is filled via `resolve_libc_imports`. The result is a fully-populated `backdoor_shared_libraries_data_t` for\ndownstream stages.",
  "resolve_libc_imports": "Treats `link_map *libc` as another ELF image, runs `elf_parse` to populate `elf_info_t`, and then allocates trampolines for\n`read` and `__errno_location` via the fake allocator shim. Only when both imports succeed does it mark `libc_imports_t` as\nready, ensuring subsequent socket I/O helpers can operate without touching the real PLT.",
  "rsa_key_hash": "Grabs the exponent and modulus via RSA_get0_key, serialises the exponent first and the modulus second with bignum_serialize into\na ~4 KiB stack buffer, and runs sha256 over the exact number of bytes produced. Any missing component or overflow of the\n0x100a-byte scratch cancels the fingerprint.",
  "run_backdoor_commands": "Master dispatcher for the RSA hooks. It refuses to run unless the secret-data bitmap is complete, extracts the modulus and\nexponent via RSA_get0_key, and uses the modulus bytes as a transport for an encrypted payload header/body. The body is decrypted\nwith the ChaCha keys from secret_data_get_decrypted, every cached sshd host key is hashed (rsa_key_hash/dsa_key_hash/etc.) until\nthe embedded Ed448 signature verifies, and the resulting command toggles global_ctx state (sshd_offsets, syslog/PAM controls,\nsocket selection, payload streaming state). When a payload wants execution it populates a monitor_data_t and calls\nsshd_proxy_elevate; otherwise it patches sshd variables/logging in place. Any parse/signature failure sets\nctx->disable_backdoor, leaves *do_orig = TRUE, and the real OpenSSL routine proceeds untouched.",
  "secret_data_append_from_address": "Lets hooks fingerprint themselves without a static code pointer. If addr is NULL/1 it substitutes the caller’s return address,\notherwise it uses the explicit address, and in either case it forwards both the call site and the resolved code pointer to\nsecret_data_append_singleton.",
  "secret_data_append_from_call_site": "Shortcut used directly inside hooks: it grabs the caller’s return address (unaff_retaddr), runs secret_data_append_singleton\nwith it, and ORs the result with the supplied bypass flag so instrumentation sites can opt out when the attestation fails.",
  "secret_data_append_from_code": "Sweeps a code range and feeds instructions to secret_data_append_from_instruction. When start_from_call is TRUE it first finds\nthe next CALL via find_call_instruction, then loops up to shift_count times, each time calling find_reg2reg_instruction to\nlocate a qualifying instruction and shifting the supplied cursor. Returning FALSE means it could not find enough instructions in\nthe provided span.",
  "secret_data_append_from_instruction": "Sets the next bit inside global_ctx->secret_data based on a decoded instruction. The cursor enforces the 0x1C8-bit ceiling,\nskips certain opcodes (0x109, 0xBB, and entries in the precomputed 0x83–0xB1 mask), and otherwise locates the byte/bit inside\nthe secret_data array and ORs it in before advancing the cursor.",
  "secret_data_append_item": "Convenience wrapper used by the secret-data descriptor tables: when the supplied index is non-zero it simply calls\nsecret_data_append_singleton with the provided code pointer and cursor, otherwise it treats the entry as disabled and reports\nFALSE so the batch runner can bail out early.",
  "secret_data_append_items": "Batch driver for arrays of secret_data_item_t. It assigns sequential indexes to entries that have not been initialised yet,\ncalls the provided appender for each descriptor (passing the 1-based ordinal and the recorded code pointer), and stops at the\nfirst failure so callers know whether the entire batch completed.",
  "secret_data_append_singleton": "Guarantees each attestation slot runs at most once. It uses the per-operation byte array inside global_ctx->shift_operations to\nguard entry, resolves the function boundaries with find_function relative to the recorded sshd code limits, invokes\nsecret_data_append_from_code (starting after the call site if present), and increments global_ctx->num_shifted_bits by\nshift_count on success.",
  "secret_data_get_decrypted": "Unwraps the 57-byte global_ctx->secret_data blob with two ChaCha passes. A baked-in key/IV pair (the key_buf constants) decrypts\na 0x30-byte seed, that seed becomes the real ChaCha key, and a second decrypt peels the runtime secret into the caller buffer\nusing another static IV. All operations go through the resolved EVP entry points so no static crypto ships with the implant.",
  "sha256": "Thin wrapper around EVP_Digest/Evp_sha256: it rejects empty buffers, refuses to write unless mdBuf has at least 32 bytes of\nspace, looks up OpenSSL’s SHA-256 implementation via the import table, and hashes the supplied payload in place.",
  "sshbuf_bignum_is_negative": "Treats an sshbuf as a serialized big integer. When the payload is between 0x20 and 0x40 bytes it scans forward until it finds a\nbyte with the sign bit set; encountering such a byte before hitting the end marks the buffer as “negative” and therefore\nsuitable for modulus harvesting.",
  "sshbuf_extract": "Reads out an sshbuf’s d pointer and size field using the dynamic layout encoded in global_ctx->sshd_offsets. Depending on\nwhether each qword index is negative it either uses the struct fields directly or walks to the encoded offset, confirms both the\nstruct and the pointed-to range are mapped with is_range_mapped, and hands the caller the live pointer/length pair.",
  "sshd_configure_log_hook": "Validates that the caller provided writable log handler slots plus the format strings needed to rewrite messages, and\nonly honours logging requests when the controlling flag (bit 3 in `cmd_flags->flags1`) is set or the backdoor is already\nrunning as root. If the existing handler/context pointers already reside inside sshd it swaps them so the implant can\nhijack them safely, snapshots the original function/context, and either disables logging entirely or enables filtering\nmode. In filter mode it verifies that the `%s`, `\"Connection closed by\"`, and `\"(preauth)\"` strings are available before\ndropping `mm_log_handler_hook` into place.",
  "sshd_find_main": "Walks sshd's entry thunk from `Elf64_Ehdr::e_entry`, borrowing the fake lzma allocator (with `libcrypto` stored in\n`opaque`) to fetch `EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key`, `EVP_Digest`, and `EVP_sha256`. While decoding instructions it watches\nfor a RIP-relative MOV/LEA that materialises the real `sshd_main` pointer and insists that the very next CALL targets\nthe `__libc_start_main@GOT` slot via the same register. When the pattern matches it records the discovered entry point,\nbumps the resolved-count for every EVP helper it cached into `imported_funcs`, and hands the caller the exact code\naddress instead of the PLT stub.",
  "sshd_find_monitor_field_addr_in_function": "Disassembles a monitor helper and repeatedly calls `find_mov_lea_instruction` until it sees a register loaded from the\nsshd .bss/.data window. It then limits itself to the next ~0x40 bytes of code, tracks that register through LEA/MOV\nmirroring, and confirms that it flows unmodified into a nearby call to `mm_request_send`. When those conditions hold it\nreturns the referenced data address so the caller can treat it as the monitor struct slot (sendfd, recvfd, sshbuf\npointer, etc.).",
  "sshd_find_monitor_struct": "Instruments the ten monitor-side helpers referenced in `string_refs` (allocation, channel handling, recv/send paths,\netc.) by calling `sshd_find_monitor_field_addr_in_function` for each one. Every returned BSS address is tallied, and\nonce a value shows up at least five times the routine records it in `ctx->struct_monitor_ptr_address` so later hooks can\ndereference monitor->monitor_to_child_fd/child_to_monitor_fd directly. The helper also emits a `secret_data_append_from_call_site`\nbreadcrumb so the secret-data mirroring code knows when monitor discovery succeeded.",
  "sshd_find_sensitive_data": "Bootstraps the entire sensitive-data pipeline: it appends bookkeeping entries for `sshd_proxy_elevate`/socket helpers\ninto the secret-data log, uses the fake lzma allocator (pointed at libcrypto) to resolve `EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key`,\n`EVP_Digest`, `EVP_DigestVerify`, `EVP_DigestVerifyInit`, `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new`, `EVP_chacha20`, and sanity-checks that\nthe library exports the `EVP_sm*` family the payload expects. It locates sshd's code/data segments, finds the real\n`sshd_main` entry (recording whether an ENDBR64 prefix is present), and runs both the xcalloc-based and `KRB5CCNAME`\nheuristics to recover candidate struct addresses. Each candidate is scored via `sshd_get_sensitive_data_score`, and\nwhichever pointer clears the >=8 threshold is stored in `ctx->sshd_sensitive_data`; on failure all of the just-resolved\nlibcrypto stubs are freed before the helper reports that no recon data was found.",
  "sshd_get_client_socket": "Prefers the recovered monitor struct when one is available: it selects monitor->child_to_monitor_fd for DIR_WRITE and\nmonitor->monitor_to_child_fd for DIR_READ, verifies the descriptor by issuing a zero-length `read()` that tolerates EINTR, and\nreturns it on success. If the monitor pointer is unmapped or the fd is dead/EBADF it falls back to\n`sshd_get_usable_socket`, letting callers still obtain a socket handle by index.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_address_via_krb5ccname": "Starts from the unique reference to `\"KRB5CCNAME\"` and walks forward through the surrounding basic blocks. It only\naccepts MOV/LEA instructions that copy getenv's return value into memory inside sshd's .data/.bss range with the same\n-0x18 displacement pattern used by OpenSSH's `sensitive_data` struct. The address (minus 0x18) is returned as the\ncandidate base pointer that later holds host key material and Kerberos cache metadata.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_address_via_xcalloc": "Consults the precomputed string-reference table to find the code region that contains sshd's zero-initialisation\n`xcalloc` call. Immediately after each matching CALL it scans the next handful of instructions for stores into .bss,\nrecords up to sixteen unique destinations, and looks for three consecutive slots separated by eight bytes (ptr, ptr+8,\nptr+0x10). That stride pattern matches the layout of `sensitive_data`, so the lowest address of the triplet becomes the\npreferred candidate.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score": "Combines the per-function heuristics by doubling the `demote_sensitive_data` and `main()` scores, adding them together,\nand finally tacking on the `do_child` result. Only candidates that reach eight or more points are surfaced to the rest\nof the implant; weaker hits are ignored even if one heuristic thought they were promising.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_demote_sensitive_data": "Disassembles the string-identified `demote_sensitive_data` helper and returns three points as soon as any memory operand\ntouches the candidate pointer. That helper is tightly coupled to the real struct, so even a single hit is treated as\nstrong evidence in the aggregate score.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_do_child": "Uses the string catalogue to locate `do_child` and counts how many memory operands touch the supplied pointer at offsets\n0 and +0x10. Touching the base is worth one point while seeing multiple hits on +0x10 yields up to two more, so routines\nthat read both halves of the struct bubble to the top. The tiny score (0–3) feeds into the aggregate heuristic that\nselects the best candidate.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_main": "Looks inside the cached `main()` range and searches for memory references to the struct at offsets 0, +8, and +0x10. It\ngives +1 when the base is accessed, +1 when +0x10 is touched, and subtracts one when +8 never shows up, producing a\nsigned score between -1 and +3. The result is doubled later so the decision logic favours pointers that the main daemon\nmanipulates frequently.",
  "sshd_get_sshbuf": "Finds the sshbuf inside sshd’s monitor structure that now holds the forged modulus. It dereferences\nglobal_ctx->struct_monitor_ptr_address, uses the packed sshd_offsets to identify the m_pkex pointer and the sshbuf data/size\nfields, and validates any candidate via sshbuf_extract. When offsets are unknown it brute-forces the pkex table: two buffers\nmust decode to “SSH-2.0”/“ssh-2.0” string IDs and the next buffer must look like a negative bignum (sshbuf_bignum_is_negative).\nOnly then does it return the mapped sshbuf->d pointer and length.",
  "sshd_get_usable_socket": "Runs a brute-force probe across file descriptors 0–63, calling `shutdown(fd, SHUT_RDWR)` on each one and treating\n`EINVAL`/`ENOTCONN` (or a non-zero return) as evidence that the descriptor is open but idle. Every candidate bumps a\ncounter, and when the counter reaches the requested `socket_index` the fd is returned to the caller so implants can\nrecycle sshd's sockets even when the monitor struct is missing.",
  "sshd_log": "Builds a fresh `va_list` that mirrors sshd's sshlogv() calling convention, saving and restoring the XMM argument\nregisters when the ABI says variadic SSE arguments are present. It then tail-calls the resolved sshlogv pointer stored\nin the logging context so higher-level hooks can format log lines exactly the way sshd expects without resolving libc\nwrappers first.",
  "sshd_patch_variables": "Requires the mm_answer_authpassword hook and metadata to have been recovered, then applies three optional tweaks: force\nPermitRootLogin to the value `3` (\"yes\"), zero out `use_pam` when PAM should be disabled, and replace sshd's monitor\ndispatch table entry with the attacker's authpassword hook. When `monitor_reqtype` isn't explicitly supplied it is\nderived from the original dispatch table so the forged replies stay in lock-step with sshd's state machine.",
  "sshd_proxy_elevate": "Implements the privileged side of the monitor command channel. It validates the supplied RSA components, command flags,\nand libc/import tables; rejects unsupported command types; and decides whether PAM should be disabled or sshd should\nexit outright based on the flag bits. For KEYALLOWED-style payloads it hunts for the staged ChaCha-wrapped blob on the\nstack, decrypts and hashes it, emits a forged `MONITOR_REQ_KEYALLOWED` packet (creating temporary BIGNUM/RSA objects\npopulated with the attacker's modulus/exponent), and writes it over the selected monitor socket or the fd discovered via\n`sshd_get_client_socket`. After sending optional sshbuf payloads it drains replies, honours \"wait\" vs \"fire-and-forget\"\nsemantics, and updates the monitor request IDs so sshd's dispatcher believes the forged exchange was legitimate.",
  "update_cpuid_got_index": "Copies the relocation constants baked into `tls_get_addr_reloc_consts` into `ctx->got_ctx.cpuid_slot_index`. That value is the\nGOT index of the cpuid resolver inside liblzma, so later code can patch the correct slot without rescanning the PLT stub.",
  "update_got_address": "Disassembles liblzma's `__tls_get_addr` PLT stub, accounts for the short/long JMP encodings, and then computes the true GOT\nentry by applying the stub's 32-bit displacement. The resulting pointer is cached in `ctx->got_ctx.tls_got_entry` and later used\nas the anchor when swapping the cpuid GOT slot over to the implant's resolver.",
  "update_got_offset": "Copies `_Llzma_block_buffer_decode_0` into `ctx->got_ctx.got_base_offset`, giving the loader a reproducible base when\ntranslating between the baked relocation constants and runtime addresses. It pairs with `update_got_address` during the cpuid\nGOT patch.",
  "validate_log_handler_pointers": "Given two candidate addresses for sshd’s `log_handler`/`log_handler_ctx` globals, it replays the code sequence that writes them.\nThe helper enforces that the pointers are distinct and within 0x10 bytes of one another, walks the cached string-reference\nentries to find the LEA that materialises the handler struct, bounds the routine via `x86_dasm`/`find_function`, and then\nsearches for MOV [mem],reg instructions touching each address. Only when both stores appear inside that function does it accept\nthe pair as the genuine log-handler slots.",
  "verify_signature": "Computes the host-key digest that sits at sshkey_digest_offset inside the signed blob and then verifies the Ed448 command\nsignature. RSA and DSA keys delegate to rsa_key_hash/dsa_key_hash, ECDSA serialises the EC_POINT in uncompressed form with a\n32-bit length prefix, and Ed25519 prepends a 0x20000000 tag plus the raw 32-byte key. Once the digest is spliced into\nsigned_data the helper loads the attacker’s Ed448 public key with EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key(0x440, …) and invokes\nEVP_DigestVerify over the signed_data[0:tbslen) region; only a valid Ed448 signature lets the caller continue.",
