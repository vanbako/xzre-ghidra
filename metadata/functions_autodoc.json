  "elf_find_string": "Iterates through the cached `.rodata` window, calling `get_string_id` on each byte offset until it encounters a recognizable encoded string. If `*stringId_inOut` is zero the first discovered string wins and its id is written back; otherwise the search continues until an exact id match is found. The optional `rodata_start_ptr` lets callers resume from a previous location or constrain the search to a suffix of the segment.\n\nThe scan is gated by `secret_data_append_from_call_site`: if the telemetry helper returns FALSE the routine skips the walk entirely, ensuring rodata scrapes are always reflected in the secret-data log.\n",

  "elf_find_string_references": "Builds the 27-entry `string_references_t` catalogue used by the loader heuristics.\nSeeds each entry with its `EncodedStringId`, walks .rodata via `elf_find_string`, and records the first LEA that materialises each literal with `find_string_reference`.\nThen sweeps `.text` with `x86_dasm`, tightening each entry's `func_start`/`func_end` around calls, PLT/JMP stubs, and RIP-relative LEAs that target the recorded xrefs, and finally reconciles the ranges against RELA/RELR relocations and the code-segment bounds so later scans can trust the table.",
  "elf_get_code_segment": "Finds and caches the first executable PT_LOAD segment. The routine walks the program headers until it sees a segment with PF_X set, computes the runtime address by subtracting the ELF's minimum virtual address from `p_vaddr`, page-aligns both ends, stores the start/size inside `elf_info_t`, and returns the aligned base while writing the computed size through `pSize`. Subsequent calls use the cached values to avoid rescanning the headers.\n\nBefore touching the headers it emits a `secret_data_append_from_address` telemetry record and refuses to proceed if that hook fails, keeping the text-range discovery tied to the secret-data accounting path.\n",
  "elf_get_data_segment": "Walks every PT_LOAD segment looking for the last read/write mapping (PF_W|PF_R). Once found it caches three pieces of\ninformation: the base of the mapped data (`data_segment_start`), the amount of padding between the end of the file-backed bytes\nand the next page boundary (`data_segment_alignment`), and the total size of the aligned segment.

It iterates through `num_relocs`, ensures the relocation type matches `reloc_type`, confirms the associated symbol is really an import (`st_shndx == 0`), and then resolves the symbol name via `get_string_id` before comparing it to `encoded_string_id`.

That keeps relocation patching tied to the secret-data accounting path so the loader never quietly rewrites GOT/PLT entries when the recorder is disabled.\n",
  "elf_get_rodata_segment": "Locates the first read-only PT_LOAD segment that lives entirely after the executable code. It first asks `elf_get_code_segment` for the text range so it can ignore overlapping pages, then scans for PF_R-only segments, page-aligns their bounds, and picks the lowest segment whose start is beyond the end of `.text`. The result is cached in `elf_info_t` and handed to callers alongside its size so later routines (string searches, RELRO probes) can reuse the computed window.\n\nThe helper begins by logging a `secret_data_append_from_call_site` record; failure to emit that telemetry causes the search to abort, so the rodata queries only run when the secret-data recorder is active.\n",
  "elf_parse": "Initialises an `elf_info_t` from an in-memory ELF header: zeroes every field, records the lowest PT_LOAD virtual address,\nlocates the PT_DYNAMIC segment, and caches pointers to the strtab, symtab, relocation tables (PLT, RELA, RELR), GNU hash\nbuckets, version records, and GNU_RELRO metadata. Each pointer retrieved from the dynamic table is validated with\n`elf_contains_vaddr` so forged headers are rejected.\n\nIt also enforces invariants such as 'only one PT_GNU_RELRO segment', derives the number of dynamic entries, and flips feature\nbits (`flags`) so later helpers know whether RELR, versym, or gnurelro data is present. Failure to locate the dynamic segment,\nfind the required headers, or keep derived pointers inside mapped memory causes the parse to abort with FALSE.",
  "elf_symbol_get": "Symbol resolver that trusts the GNU hash table the loader extracted earlier.

It returns the encoded ID when it\nreaches a terminal node or 0 when the bytes miss the trie, and is used to find SSH banner strings during sshd heuristics.",

  "hook_EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA": "Tap point for EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA so the backdoor sees every RSA handle even when the decrypt hook never fires. It simply calls\nrun_backdoor_commands on the key and then invokes the preserved OpenSSL routine.",
  "hook_RSA_get0_key": "Mirrors the same idea for RSA_get0_key: every consumer that asks OpenSSL for the modulus/exponent triggers run_backdoor_commands\nfirst, letting the implant inspect/track the RSA handle before delegating to the original function.",
  "hook_RSA_public_decrypt": "Replacement for RSA_public_decrypt: it ensures the PLT pointer is resolved, hands the RSA key to run_backdoor_commands (passing\na do_orig flag by reference), and either returns the backdoor\u2019s result or forwards the call to the genuine OpenSSL symbol\ndepending on whether the dispatcher consumed the ciphertext.",
  "init_elf_entry_ctx": "Seeds an `elf_entry_ctx_t` prior to running the IFUNC resolvers. It records the address of `cpuid_random_symbol`, captures the\ncaller's return address from the saved frame (slot 3), recomputes the GOT anchor offset via `update_got_offset`, primes the\ncpuid GOT index with `update_cpuid_got_index`, and clears the cached `tls_got_entry` so the resolver will refill it. The context\nis later consumed by the GOT patching code that splices the malicious cpuid stub into sshd.",
  "init_hooks_ctx": "Primes a transient `backdoor_hooks_ctx_t` before stage two patches the GOT. It always points `hooks_data_addr` at the\n`hooks_data` blob baked into liblzma, zeros the scratch flags, and, when `ctx->shared` is still NULL, drops in the static hook\nentry points (`backdoor_symbind64`, the RSA shims, and the mm_* monitor hooks) before returning 0x65 so the caller can retry\nafter the shared globals are published. Once the shared block exists it simply returns 0, signalling that the structure now\ninherits every pointer from the shared globals.",
  "init_imported_funcs": "Sanity-checks the OpenSSL import table before the hooks are allowed to run. It requires `resolved_imports_count` to equal 0x1d\nand then inspects the `RSA_public_decrypt`, `EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA`, and `RSA_get0_key` PLT shims. If at least one of them is\nresolved it returns TRUE so later code can jump through the host's libcrypto. When all three slots are still NULL it plants\n`backdoor_init_stage2` / `init_shared_globals` in the RSA entries as crash-safe fallbacks and returns FALSE so stage two keeps\nwaiting until the imports are ready.",
  "init_ldso_ctx": "Restores every ld.so flag the implant may have touched: it writes the saved auditstate bindflags back to libcrypto/sshd, unsets\nthe copied `l_name` byte, clears the `l_audit_any_plt` bit with the mask recovered earlier, and zeros `_dl_naudit`/`_dl_audit`\nso the dynamic linker no longer believes an audit module is registered.

  "init_shared_globals": "Seeds the shared global block with the mm/EVP hook entry points and a pointer to the lone `global_ctx` instance.

  "is_gnu_relro": "Obfuscated equality test for PT_GNU_RELRO. Instead of comparing `p_type` directly against `0x6474e552`, the code adds the caller\nsupplied `addend` (always `0xa0000000`) and checks for the magic constant, which makes the instruction stream look less like a\nstraightforward RELRO probe in the object file.",

The helper aligns the requested address downward, then walks one page at\na time toward `addr + length`, invoking the host's `pselect` with NULL fd sets and the page pointer passed in as the signal mask\nargument. If `pselect` faults with EFAULT the page is unmapped, otherwise the loop continues until every page succeeds. The\nroutine relies on `ctx->libc_imports` to surface both `pselect` and `__errno_location`, and it refuses to touch addresses below\n0x01000000 to avoid probing NULL or vsyscall.",
  "j_tls_get_addr": "Jumps straight into the real `__tls_get_addr` resolver.

  "lzma_alloc": "Counterpart to `lzma_free` that also traps. Once the loader installs the fake allocator the GOT entry is overwritten with\n`fake_lzma_alloc`; if execution ever reaches this stub it means the relocation failed and the safest option is to abort\nimmediately.",

  "main_elf_parse": "Given a `main_elf_t` that already points at ld.so's ELF header, this routine parses the interpreter, looks up\n`__libc_stack_end`, and then calls `process_is_sshd` to verify that the captured runtime really belongs to sshd.

  "mm_answer_authpassword_hook": "Handles `MONITOR_REQ_AUTHPASSWORD` by replaying a prebuilt reply buffer whenever the payload provided one, or by\nsynthesizing the four-field success packet when no payload data is pending. The hook emits the reply through\n`fd_write()`, mirrors sshd's bookkeeping by copying the saved dispatch target back into the table at lVar1+0xa0, and\nreturns 1 so the monitor thread believes password authentication finished successfully without ever touching sshd's\npassword logic. Any structural error falls back to libc's `exit()` to keep the daemon from running partially patched.",
  "mm_answer_keyallowed_hook": "Runs the decrypted payload state machine. It first validates `payload_state`, extracts sshbuf chunks from the monitor\nmessage, and when state==0 it copies the signed header into `payload_data`, decrypts it via `secret_data_get_decrypted`,\nand verifies the Ed448 signature against the cached host key. State 1 and 2 append additional chunks until the\nadvertised body_length is consumed, then state 3 interprets the decrypted command: copying payloads for\nmm_answer_keyverify/mm_answer_authpassword, invoking `sshd_proxy_elevate` to run system/PAM commands, or queueing auth\npayloads. On success it patches the monitor dispatch table to point at the attacker's hooks before tail-calling the\ngenuine `mm_answer_keyallowed`; any failure resets `payload_state` (or even exits sshd) so no partially decrypted data\nis reused.",
  "mm_answer_keyverify_hook": "Pulls the canned monitor reply out of the global payload context and writes it straight to the requesting socket via\n`fd_write()`. If the write succeeds it restores the original mm_answer_keyverify pointer so sshd's dispatcher advances\nas if verification succeeded; if it fails the hook invokes libc's `exit()` to avoid leaving sshd mid-patch.

  "mm_log_handler_hook": "Interposes on sshd's log handler, bailing out entirely when logging has been globally disabled or sshd already dropped\nprivileges back to the sandbox. In filtering mode it scans the formatted string for the `\"Connection closed by ...\n(preauth)\"` pattern, rebuilds a safe replacement message from attacker-provided format strings, and emits it through\n`sshd_log()` while optionally muting syslog via the saved libc pointers. Messages that mention accepted authentication\nevents trigger a second rewrite path so only the sanitised strings ever reach sshd's real logger.",
  "process_is_sshd": "Replays sshd's argc/argv/envp layout straight off the stack pointer: it checks that argc is sane, argv[0] points above\nthe stack and hashes to `/usr/sbin/sshd`, and every subsequent argv entry lives within 0x4000 bytes of the saved SP.\nEach argument is passed through `check_argument`, and once it reaches envp it enforces that every pointer is either\nstack-resident or located inside sshd's .data segment. Any environment string that matches a known identifier (via\n`get_string_id`) or falls outside those regions terminates the probe so the loader only runs inside real sshd processes.",
  "process_shared_libraries": "Wrapper around `process_shared_libraries_map` that first resolves `r_debug` out of ld.so, copies the caller-provided struct into\na local scratch copy, and feeds the scratch copy into the map-walker.

  "rsa_key_hash": "Grabs the exponent and modulus via RSA_get0_key, serialises the exponent first and the modulus second with bignum_serialize into\na ~4 KiB stack buffer, and runs sha256 over the exact number of bytes produced.

  "run_backdoor_commands": "Master dispatcher for the RSA hooks. It refuses to run unless the secret-data bitmap is complete, extracts the modulus and\nexponent via RSA_get0_key, and uses the modulus bytes as a transport for an encrypted payload header/body. The body is decrypted\nwith the ChaCha keys from secret_data_get_decrypted, every cached sshd host key is hashed (rsa_key_hash/dsa_key_hash/etc.) until\nthe embedded Ed448 signature verifies, and the resulting command toggles global_ctx state (sshd_offsets, syslog/PAM controls,\nsocket selection, payload streaming state). When a payload wants execution it populates a monitor_data_t and calls\nsshd_proxy_elevate; otherwise it patches sshd variables/logging in place. Any parse/signature failure sets\nctx->disable_backdoor, leaves *do_orig = TRUE, and the real OpenSSL routine proceeds untouched.",
  "secret_data_append_from_address": "Lets hooks fingerprint themselves without a static code pointer. If addr is NULL/1 it substitutes the caller\u2019s return address,\notherwise it uses the explicit address, and in either case it forwards both the call site and the resolved code pointer to\nsecret_data_append_singleton.",
  "secret_data_append_from_call_site": "Shortcut used directly inside hooks: it grabs the caller\u2019s return address (unaff_retaddr), runs secret_data_append_singleton\nwith it, and ORs the result with the supplied bypass flag so instrumentation sites can opt out when the attestation fails.",
  "secret_data_append_from_code": "Sweeps a code range and feeds instructions to secret_data_append_from_instruction. When start_from_call is TRUE it first finds\nthe next CALL via find_call_instruction, then loops up to shift_count times, each time calling find_reg2reg_instruction to\nlocate a qualifying instruction and shifting the supplied cursor. Returning FALSE means it could not find enough instructions in\nthe provided span.",
  "secret_data_append_from_instruction": "Sets the next bit inside global_ctx->secret_data based on a decoded instruction. The cursor enforces the 0x1C8-bit ceiling,\nskips certain opcodes (0x109, 0xBB, and entries in the precomputed 0x83\u20130xB1 mask), and otherwise locates the byte/bit inside\nthe secret_data array and ORs it in before advancing the cursor.",
  "secret_data_append_item": "Convenience wrapper used by the secret-data descriptor tables: when the supplied index is non-zero it simply calls\nsecret_data_append_singleton with the provided code pointer and cursor, otherwise it treats the entry as disabled and reports\nFALSE so the batch runner can bail out early.",
  "secret_data_append_items": "Batch driver for arrays of secret_data_item_t. It assigns sequential indexes to entries that have not been initialised yet,\ncalls the provided appender for each descriptor (passing the 1-based ordinal and the recorded code pointer), and stops at the\nfirst failure so callers know whether the entire batch completed.",
  "secret_data_append_singleton": "Guarantees each attestation slot runs at most once. It uses the per-operation byte array inside global_ctx->shift_operations to\nguard entry, resolves the function boundaries with find_function relative to the recorded sshd code limits, invokes\nsecret_data_append_from_code (starting after the call site if present), and increments global_ctx->num_shifted_bits by\nshift_count on success.",
  "secret_data_get_decrypted": "Unwraps the 57-byte global_ctx->secret_data blob with two ChaCha passes. A baked-in key/IV pair (the key_buf constants) decrypts\na 0x30-byte seed, that seed becomes the real ChaCha key, and a second decrypt peels the runtime secret into the caller buffer\nusing another static IV. All operations go through the resolved EVP entry points so no static crypto ships with the implant.",
  "sha256": "Thin wrapper around EVP_Digest/Evp_sha256: it rejects empty buffers, refuses to write unless mdBuf has at least 32 bytes of\nspace, looks up OpenSSL\u2019s SHA-256 implementation via the import table, and hashes the supplied payload in place.",
  "sshbuf_bignum_is_negative": "Treats an sshbuf as a serialized big integer. When the payload is between 0x20 and 0x40 bytes it scans forward until it finds a\nbyte with the sign bit set; encountering such a byte before hitting the end marks the buffer as \u201cnegative\u201d and therefore\nsuitable for modulus harvesting.",
  "sshbuf_extract": "Reads out an sshbuf\u2019s d pointer and size field using the dynamic layout encoded in global_ctx->sshd_offsets. Depending on\nwhether each qword index is negative it either uses the struct fields directly or walks to the encoded offset, confirms both the\nstruct and the pointed-to range are mapped with is_range_mapped, and hands the caller the live pointer/length pair.",
  "sshd_configure_log_hook": "Validates that the caller provided writable log handler slots plus the format strings needed to rewrite messages, and\nonly honours logging requests when the controlling flag (bit 3 in `cmd_flags->flags1`) is set or the backdoor is already\nrunning as root. If the existing handler/context pointers already reside inside sshd it swaps them so the implant can\nhijack them safely, snapshots the original function/context, and either disables logging entirely or enables filtering\nmode. In filter mode it verifies that the `%s`, `\"Connection closed by\"`, and `\"(preauth)\"` strings are available before\ndropping `mm_log_handler_hook` into place.",
  "sshd_find_main": "Walks sshd's entry thunk from `Elf64_Ehdr::e_entry`, borrowing the fake lzma allocator (with `libcrypto` stored in\n`opaque`) to fetch `EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key`, `EVP_Digest`, and `EVP_sha256`. While decoding instructions it watches\nfor a RIP-relative MOV/LEA that materialises the real `sshd_main` pointer and insists that the very next CALL targets\nthe `__libc_start_main@GOT` slot via the same register. When the pattern matches it records the discovered entry point,\nbumps the resolved-count for every EVP helper it cached into `imported_funcs`, and hands the caller the exact code\naddress instead of the PLT stub.",
  "sshd_find_monitor_field_addr_in_function": "Disassembles a monitor helper and repeatedly calls `find_mov_lea_instruction` until it sees a register loaded from the\nsshd .bss/.data window. It then limits itself to the next ~0x40 bytes of code, tracks that register through LEA/MOV\nmirroring, and confirms that it flows unmodified into a nearby call to `mm_request_send`. When those conditions hold it\nreturns the referenced data address so the caller can treat it as the monitor struct slot (sendfd, recvfd, sshbuf\npointer, etc.).",
  "sshd_find_monitor_struct": "Instruments the ten monitor-side helpers referenced in `string_refs` (allocation, channel handling, recv/send paths,\netc.) by calling `sshd_find_monitor_field_addr_in_function` for each one. Every returned BSS address is tallied, and\nonce a value shows up at least five times the routine records it in `ctx->struct_monitor_ptr_address` so later hooks can\ndereference monitor->monitor_to_child_fd/child_to_monitor_fd directly.

  "sshd_find_sensitive_data": "Bootstraps the entire sensitive-data pipeline: it appends bookkeeping entries for `sshd_proxy_elevate`/socket helpers\ninto the secret-data log, uses the fake lzma allocator (pointed at libcrypto) to resolve `EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key`,\n`EVP_Digest`, `EVP_DigestVerify`, `EVP_DigestVerifyInit`, `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new`, `EVP_chacha20`, and sanity-checks that\nthe library exports the `EVP_sm*` family the payload expects. It locates sshd's code/data segments, finds the real\n`sshd_main` entry (recording whether an ENDBR64 prefix is present), and runs both the xcalloc-based and `KRB5CCNAME`\nheuristics to recover candidate struct addresses. Each candidate is scored via `sshd_get_sensitive_data_score`, and\nwhichever pointer clears the >=8 threshold is stored in `ctx->sshd_sensitive_data`; on failure all of the just-resolved\nlibcrypto stubs are freed before the helper reports that no recon data was found.",
  "sshd_get_client_socket": "Prefers the recovered monitor struct when one is available: it selects monitor->child_to_monitor_fd for DIR_WRITE and\nmonitor->monitor_to_child_fd for DIR_READ, verifies the descriptor by issuing a zero-length `read()` that tolerates EINTR, and\nreturns it on success. If the monitor pointer is unmapped or the fd is dead/EBADF it falls back to\n`sshd_get_usable_socket`, letting callers still obtain a socket handle by index.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_address_via_krb5ccname": "Starts from the unique reference to `\"KRB5CCNAME\"` and walks forward through the surrounding basic blocks. It only\naccepts MOV/LEA instructions that copy getenv's return value into memory inside sshd's .data/.bss range with the same\n-0x18 displacement pattern used by OpenSSH's `sensitive_data` struct. The address (minus 0x18) is returned as the\ncandidate base pointer that later holds host key material and Kerberos cache metadata.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_address_via_xcalloc": "Consults the precomputed string-reference table to find the code region that contains sshd's zero-initialisation\n`xcalloc` call. Immediately after each matching CALL it scans the next handful of instructions for stores into .bss,\nrecords up to sixteen unique destinations, and looks for three consecutive slots separated by eight bytes (ptr, ptr+8,\nptr+0x10). That stride pattern matches the layout of `sensitive_data`, so the lowest address of the triplet becomes the\npreferred candidate.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score": "Combines the per-function heuristics by doubling the `demote_sensitive_data` and `main()` scores, adding them together,\nand finally tacking on the `do_child` result. Only candidates that reach eight or more points are surfaced to the rest\nof the implant; weaker hits are ignored even if one heuristic thought they were promising.",
  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_demote_sensitive_data": "Disassembles the string-identified `demote_sensitive_data` helper and returns three points as soon as any memory operand\ntouches the candidate pointer.

  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_do_child": "Uses the string catalogue to locate `do_child` and counts how many memory operands touch the supplied pointer at offsets\n0 and +0x10. Touching the base is worth one point while seeing multiple hits on +0x10 yields up to two more, so routines\nthat read both halves of the struct bubble to the top.

  "sshd_get_sensitive_data_score_in_main": "Looks inside the cached `main()` range and searches for memory references to the struct at offsets 0, +8, and +0x10. It\ngives +1 when the base is accessed, +1 when +0x10 is touched, and subtracts one when +8 never shows up, producing a\nsigned score between -1 and +3. The result is doubled later so the decision logic favours pointers that the main daemon\nmanipulates frequently.",
  "sshd_get_sshbuf": "Finds the sshbuf inside sshd\u2019s monitor structure that now holds the forged modulus. It dereferences\nglobal_ctx->struct_monitor_ptr_address, uses the packed sshd_offsets to identify the m_pkex pointer and the sshbuf data/size\nfields, and validates any candidate via sshbuf_extract. When offsets are unknown it brute-forces the pkex table: two buffers\nmust decode to \u201cSSH-2.0\u201d/\u201cssh-2.0\u201d string IDs and the next buffer must look like a negative bignum (sshbuf_bignum_is_negative).\nOnly then does it return the mapped sshbuf->d pointer and length.",
  "sshd_get_usable_socket": "Runs a brute-force probe across file descriptors 0\u201363, calling `shutdown(fd, SHUT_RDWR)` on each one and treating\n`EINVAL`/`ENOTCONN` (or a non-zero return) as evidence that the descriptor is open but idle. Every candidate bumps a\ncounter, and when the counter reaches the requested `socket_index` the fd is returned to the caller so implants can\nrecycle sshd's sockets even when the monitor struct is missing.",
  "sshd_log": "Builds a fresh `va_list` that mirrors sshd's sshlogv() calling convention, saving and restoring the XMM argument\nregisters when the ABI says variadic SSE arguments are present. It then tail-calls the resolved sshlogv pointer stored\nin the logging context so higher-level hooks can format log lines exactly the way sshd expects without resolving libc\nwrappers first.",
  "sshd_patch_variables": "Requires the mm_answer_authpassword hook and metadata to have been recovered, then applies three optional tweaks: force\nPermitRootLogin to the value `3` (\"yes\"), zero out `use_pam` when PAM should be disabled, and replace sshd's monitor\ndispatch table entry with the attacker's authpassword hook. When `monitor_reqtype` isn't explicitly supplied it is\nderived from the original dispatch table so the forged replies stay in lock-step with sshd's state machine.",
  "sshd_proxy_elevate": "Implements the privileged side of the monitor command channel. It validates the supplied RSA components, command flags,\nand libc/import tables; rejects unsupported command types; and decides whether PAM should be disabled or sshd should\nexit outright based on the flag bits. For KEYALLOWED-style payloads it hunts for the staged ChaCha-wrapped blob on the\nstack, decrypts and hashes it, emits a forged `MONITOR_REQ_KEYALLOWED` packet (creating temporary BIGNUM/RSA objects\npopulated with the attacker's modulus/exponent), and writes it over the selected monitor socket or the fd discovered via\n`sshd_get_client_socket`. After sending optional sshbuf payloads it drains replies, honours \"wait\" vs \"fire-and-forget\"\nsemantics, and updates the monitor request IDs so sshd's dispatcher believes the forged exchange was legitimate.",
  "update_cpuid_got_index": "Copies the relocation constants baked into `tls_get_addr_reloc_consts` into `ctx->got_ctx.cpuid_slot_index`. That value is the\nGOT index of the cpuid resolver inside liblzma, so later code can patch the correct slot without rescanning the PLT stub.",

  "update_got_offset": "Copies `_Llzma_block_buffer_decode_0` into `ctx->got_ctx.got_base_offset`, giving the loader a reproducible base when\ntranslating between the baked relocation constants and runtime addresses. It pairs with `update_got_address` during the cpuid\nGOT patch.",
  "validate_log_handler_pointers": "Given two candidate addresses for sshd\u2019s `log_handler`/`log_handler_ctx` globals, it replays the code sequence that writes them.\nThe helper enforces that the pointers are distinct and within 0x10 bytes of one another, walks the cached string-reference\nentries to find the LEA that materialises the handler struct, bounds the routine via `x86_dasm`/`find_function`, and then\nsearches for MOV [mem],reg instructions touching each address.
