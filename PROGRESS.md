# Progress Log

Document notable steps taken while building out the Ghidra analysis environment for the xzre artifacts. Add new entries in reverse chronological order and include enough context so another analyst can pick up where you left off.

## 2025-10-31
- Hooked `RenameFromLinkerMap.py` into the refresh pipeline before signature replay (and hardened `ApplyLocalsFromXzreSources.py` for array types) so re-importing the object no longer strips the xzre symbol names; signature coverage is back to 100%, and the locals script now applies cleanly (31 locals updated, 1 function missing because it lacks locals in this build) — next: watch for any future object drops that omit those symbols so we can decide whether to gate the locals step.
- Added `scripts/extract_local_variables.py` plus the headless helper `ghidra_scripts/ApplyLocalsFromXzreSources.py`, regenerated the local-variable JSON map, and wired both into `scripts/refresh_xzre_project.sh` so every refresh replays the xzre decompiled locals; functions without compiler-emitted locals are skipped automatically, but the generated map is ready for richer objects if/when we import them — next: bring in the object that contains the remaining backdoor routines (or reconcile their symbol names) to expand coverage further.
- Created `scripts/refresh_xzre_project.sh` and documented it in `AGENTS.md` so every headless refresh re-imports the object, reapplies xzre headers, invokes `ApplySignaturesFromHeader.py`, and exports the portable archive in one step — next: wire the helper into any CI/automation that rebuilds the investigation workspace.
- Extended `ghidra_scripts/ApplySignaturesFromHeader.py` so every headless signature refresh now assigns the compiler's default System V AMD64 calling convention to any remaining `unknown` functions, keeping ABI warnings suppressed automatically — next: consider pruning the standalone `SetDefaultCallingConvention.py` once downstream workflows have migrated to the integrated path.
- Confirmed the `x86:LE:64` gcc compiler spec maps its default `__stdcall` prototype to the System V AMD64 ABI, added helper scripts (`ListCallingConventionNames.py`, `ListUnknownCallingConventions.py`, `SetDefaultCallingConvention.py`), fixed 125 functions with unknown conventions, verified the cleanup headlessly, and refreshed `ghidra_projects/xzre_ghidra_portable.zip` — next: fold the default-convention script into any future signature import workflows so reimports stay warning-free.
- Added `ghidra_scripts/ListFunctionSignatures.py` and ran it headlessly to dump all `liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` prototypes, then diffed the output against `ghidra_scripts/xzre_types_import_preprocessed.h` — uncovered 31 mismatches (missing const qualifiers, typedef drift like `uint` vs `unsigned int`, and the `secret_data_append_items` appender callback type) that still need to be resolved before the database matches upstream.
- Built `ghidra_scripts/InspectFunctionTypes.py` plus scratch script `TestParseConst.py` to inspect the active signature datatypes; reapplying the header definitions confirmed that the remaining gaps are cosmetic quirks in Ghidra’s C parser (it canonicalises `const` away, folds `struct` tags into typedef names, and renders function-pointer callbacks as typedef pointers). No functional mismatches remain, so further changes would require upstream adjustments to the parser or accepting alternative renderings — Next: document the acceptable deltas in any downstream comparison tooling if strict textual equality is required.

## 2025-10-30
- Added the nine missing extern prototypes (`__tls_get_addr`, `elf_contains_vaddr_impl`, `elf_find_rela_reloc`, `elf_find_relr_reloc`, `hook_EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA`, `hook_RSA_get0_key`, `j_tls_get_addr`, `lzma_check_init`, `lzma_free`) into `xzre/xzre.h`, regenerated `ghidra_scripts/xzre_types_import_preprocessed.h`, reran the import/signature pass, and refreshed the portable archive — Ghidra now reports zero missing prototypes with the OpenSSL hooks now typed against forward-declared structs for const-correctness.
- Ran `ImportXzreTypes.py` headlessly against `ghidra_scripts/xzre_types_import_preprocessed.h` so every xzre function signature and related typedef now lives in the `liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` program — this aligns Ghidra’s database with the upstream headers for cleaner decompilation.
- Regenerated `ghidra_projects/xzre_ghidra_portable.zip` via `ExportProjectArchive.py` to capture the refreshed project state — next: review the decompiler output for comment/annotation passes.
- Added helper scripts (`ghidra_scripts/ListDefaultNamedFunctions.py`, `ghidra_scripts/ListAllFunctions.py`, `ghidra_scripts/RenameFromLinkerMap.py`) and ran the rename pass so every function now matches its identifier from `xzre/xzre.lds.in` (default-name count dropped to zero) — next: extend `xzre.h`/import headers for the remaining `// FIXME: prototype` entries and annotate high-priority routines.
- Created `ghidra_scripts/ApplySignaturesFromHeader.py` (plus `ListFunctionDefinitions.py` for sanity checks) and applied header prototypes to 116 functions via headless Ghidra.

## 2025-10-29
- Imported sanitized xzre headers via `ghidra_scripts/ImportXzreTypes.py` to register typedefs/enums/structs for the program in `liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` — ensures Ghidra has all backdoor type information needed for signature work — Next: align the actual function prototypes with these imported data types.
- Added headless export script (`ghidra_scripts/ExportProjectArchive.py`) and generated `ghidra_projects/xzre_ghidra_portable.zip` to snapshot the project without committing live `.rep` state.
- Created the headless Ghidra project `xzre_ghidra` under `ghidra_projects/` and imported `xzre/liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` using `~/tools/ghidra_11.4.2_PUBLIC/support/analyzeHeadless`.
