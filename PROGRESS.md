# Progress Log

Document notable steps taken while building out the Ghidra analysis environment for the xzre artifacts. Add new entries in reverse chronological order and include enough context so another analyst can pick up where you left off.

## 2025-10-29
- Added headless export script (`ghidra_scripts/ExportProjectArchive.py`) and generated `ghidra_projects/xzre_ghidra_portable.zip` to snapshot the project without committing live `.rep` state.
- Created the headless Ghidra project `xzre_ghidra` under `ghidra_projects/` and imported `xzre/liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` using `~/tools/ghidra_11.4.2_PUBLIC/support/analyzeHeadless`.
